# 🛡️ myTIME: The Sovereign Dojo

**"We don't block. We engage. We exhaust."**

`myTIME` is a decentralized system designed to turn the tide against social engineering. By utilizing the "Building Crew" model of specialized AI agents, we transform a nuisance into a high-fidelity "Learning Repo" for the future of Angelic Intelligence.

## 🚀 The Philosophy
Based on the principle of **"Giving it away to keep it,"** this template is a blueprint for a community-governed defense system. We aim for a future of no abuse by making the cost of scamming higher than the reward.

## 🧱 The Building Crew (Roles)
- **The Foreman:** Orchestrates call hand-offs and persona selection.
- **The Actor:** Low-latency voice models (Method Actors) that waste time.
- **The Architect:** Quantizes call data into actionable security patterns.
- **The Auditor:** Ensures cryptographic integrity via v2.4 AEAD Masks.
- **The Steward:** Manages the Gamification Engine and Credit Ledger.

## 🛠️ Stack & Deployment
- **Local:** Docker + Ollama (Testing ground: "The Beast" / "Rock 15").
- **Cloud:** GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) for massive horizontal scaling.
- **Privacy:** Sovereign data masking; no Meta/Facebook hooks.

## 🎮 Gamification
- **Wasted Time = Credits:** Earn credits to unlock premium "Maestro" features.
- **AI-on-AI Combat:** Detect scam bots and trigger the **Hallucination Engine**.
- **Leaderboards:** Join the ranks of the "Sovereign Sentinels."

## 🛠️ Quick Start for the Building Crew
1. **Clone the Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FnBrian79/myTIME.git
   cd myTIME
   ```
2. **One-Command Setup:**
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
   This creates directories, generates your sovereign AEAD master key, and launches all services.

3. **Verify the Crew is Active:**
   ```bash
   ./check_health.sh
   ```

4. **Pull the Persona Models:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it gauntlet-actor ollama pull llama3
   ```
5. **Connect to Google Voice:**
   Point your SIP credentials in `config/asterisk/pjsip.conf` to your Google Voice or Twilio number.
